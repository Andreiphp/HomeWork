                         Developed and Programmed by 
                                 ID Software

      Never before has the shareware market seen a game of the quality of
    Commander Keen.  Ultra-high speed EGA scrolling graphics and animation
  at 40 frames per second!  (Cartoons are animated at just 24 frames/second.)

   You will need 640 RAM, with at least 520 free RAM to play Commander Keen.
    In other words, don't have too many RAM resident (TSR) programs running
    while you attempt to play Commander Keen.  You will also need an EGA or
                   VGA system.  CGA is not supported, sorry.

          Joystick and keyboard are both supported, but not the mouse.

   Apogee Software has many other exciting games, please send $6 if you would
    like a sample disk of other great games.  Mention disk size and the type
              of graphics system (CGA, EGA or VGA) that you have.

                       Thanks, and have fun with Keen!
